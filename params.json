{"name":"Polygame","tagline":"A Java™ 3D open source game engine.","body":"![Polygame Logo](http://mtronicsdev.github.io/PolyGame/images/polygame.png \"Polygame\")\r\n## A Java™ 3D open source game engine.\r\n### The goal\r\nThe goal of me developing this game engine is to make a game engine that is packed full of features and technology while still being incredibly easy to develop games with.\r\n\r\n### Under the hood\r\nThis engine is using [LWJGL 3](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3) to handle graphics and audio and is designed to be expandable, modular and future proof.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nPolygame is still a work in progress but many key features are already fully working. Here is a quick list of the most important ones:\r\n* __Modular Entities__\r\n  * Every object in the world is represented by an __entity__.\r\n  * Entities can (and most likely _will_) contain __modules__.\r\n  * Modules are the building blocks that make up entities. They can be e.g. a camera, model, audio source, AI, controller, ...\r\n  * Of course you can write _your own_ modules, but there is a number of them already included.\r\n* __Multi-window support__\r\n  * Since Polygame is using LWJGL 3 whose window manager is GLFW, it's easy to create multiple windows!\r\n  * Windows share the same world but they of course _can show completely different things_.\r\n* __Built-in terrain, water and skybox modules__\r\n  * This allows your game to _get pretty very fast_.\r\n  * Terrains can be loaded from heightmaps or can be generated at runtime.\r\n  * They also support multiple textures, so your beaches, rocks and paths can go right onto the terrain.\r\n  * Water uses _reflection, refraction and wave effects_ to appear _realistic_.\r\n  * Skyboxes are loaded from six individual images and surround the whole field of view of the bound camera entity.\r\n* __Easy resource loading__\r\n  * __One central class__ handles all the resource loading.\r\n  * __Resource handlers__ can be added to this class to load custom resource types.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
