## A Javaâ„¢ 2D/3D hybrid game engine derived from mEngine.
### The goal
The goal of me developing this game engine is to make a game engine that is packed full of features and technology while still being incredibly easy to develop games with.

### Under the hood
This engine is using LWJGL 3 to handle graphics and audio and is designed to be expandable, modular and future proof.
